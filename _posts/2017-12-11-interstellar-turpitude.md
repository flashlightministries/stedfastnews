The article claims, "The chance of an alien detection is, as always, small. But it’s not zero."

And the Russian billionaire who spends a lot of cash looking for aliens says, "If you look more, everywhere, I think chances are that eventually you will find something."

Boy, this is some unscientific, faith-based nonsense. It's unscientific and faith-based because absolutely no evidence exists to demonstrate that sentient life exists anywhere but here on earth. According to actual science, logic and statistics, the chance of detecting aliens could very well be zero because it's possible that sentient life doesn't exist anywhere but here on earth. That is, there's a chance that the chance of finding aliens is zero, and that all these desperate, godless billionaires and humanistic technophiles are wasting their time, money and energy.

To be clear, as far as we know, sentient life could exist out there, but as far as we know, it may not. Where you place your hopes and desires is the question. Some, if not most people today, believe sentient life *must* exist out there as a matter of faith.

It takes a certain kind of jerk to extract energy from life on this planet and use it to search for unknown life in the outer darkness. I don't care if that jerk is inspired by sci-fi and just loves the idea of alien discovery -- it arises from a flawed and hopeless worldview, one based on the premise that our existence is a matter of molecular roulette, sheer dumb luck, and one that must ignore the fact that God has spoken to us and shown us the truth. I say such a person is a jerk because he's taking a significant amount of treasure that could benefit people and literally jettisoning it overboard. Does he have that right as a property owner? Certainly. I'm not advocating socialism here, and nobody should be obligated to spend their wealth in a mandated way. But in the absolute moral terms of God, he's doing great harm.

The Bible doesn't say anything that would rule out aliens, but it certainly doesn't affirm the possibility in the usual sense. If we loosen up conventional thinking a bit, though, we could place aliens in the spiritual category and consider the possibility that angels, and especially demons, could manifest in that way. I do feel comfortable asserting that any such creatures, not being men of Adam and Eve, would lack souls and the potential for redemption.

All of this leads me to think that searching for ETs is not only a waste, but an invitation to disaster. I liken the search for extraterrestrial intelligence to sorcery: seeking to summon spirits for selfish gain.

Stephen Hawking also thinks finding ETs could end badly for us, citing the horrors wrought by our own explorer-colonial history, but that's a pretty anthropocentric view. I rely on God for everything, very unlike the esteemed professor Hawking, and surprisingly we come to the same misgivings about aliens. But whereas I happen to take my convictions very seriously, Hawking seems soft in his, having founded the very same Breakthrough Listen program funded by the Russian billionaire quoted in this article. It reminds me of the grave reservations physicists like Albert Einstein had over atomic weapons, even as they helped to usher them in. Such is the nature of technology in the hands of the godless and aimless: If it can be done, it will be done, because it's just so technically *sweet*, which brings to mind the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat... And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
> -- Genesis 3:12-13

> It is my judgment in these things that when you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success.
> -- Robert Oppenheimer, credited as the "father of the atomic bomb"

Sin is a bomb exploding in slow motion, and it's given birth to an obsession with life in outer space. Fittingly, those who die in their sins will be granted exactly what they're seeking: everlasting existence in the outer darkness, separated from God.
